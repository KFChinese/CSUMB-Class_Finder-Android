# Rubric For Module 
 **Phase 1: Design and create a simple Android App**  


1.  This is the only phase for this module (yea!)  
      
    
2.  Watch [the videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeY2AS7Ht9nwKvhJMXA2cPxNqpxN5l0mv) [Eight Videos] and create all that he does.  
      
    
3.  Create your own interface that would have the list of classes that must be completed in the  [CSUMB CSIT online degree](https://catalog.csumb.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=1&poid=218).  
      
    
4.  List all of the classes in the sequence, using the number and name, according to the sequence you will take them.  
      
    
5.  Create a text box where someone can enter the number of the course (ie. 338), as well as a button that will use the value in the box.  
      
    
6.  Validate that the input is only a number and not any letters. Use an invalid message that will show up.  
      
    
7.  Display below the button, the  [Course Description for that course](https://csumb.edu/scd/course-descriptions).  
      
    
8.  I want you to include the CSUMB icon. Go find it and download it. Now copy it and go to Android Studio and the "drawable" folder. Click on it and choose paste. Just click OK a couple of times to finish it. Next, go to the "common" palette and drag in ImageView. A resources box will open and then click on Project and your image will be there. Click on it and then OK.  
      
    
9.  Change the background color and the color of the text.  
      
    
10.  Include a separate zip file with screenshots of your AVD running. There should be a minimum of 4, when you first open the app, testing an invalid entry with letters, and two valid entries of two different courses.  
      
    
11.  Be sure to tell me (in the assignment submission box below) what the requirements are for me to run it in terms of the custom AVD.
